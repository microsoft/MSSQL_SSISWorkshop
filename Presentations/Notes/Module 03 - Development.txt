Q & A for each seciton

Demos?
- Create project with multiple packages.
- Creating & setting up connection.
- Demostrate each oc the Data Flow Tasks (where possible).
- Demostrate each of the Control Flow Tasks (where possible).
- Demostrate precedence constraint.
- Demostrate variable for everything.
- Making connection strings dynamics.

Labs?
- Same as demos just for users.
- For Control Flow / Data Flow focus on main tasks only.
